<h4>About Foursquare:</h4><p>
Foursquare helps you and your friends make the most of where you are. We're a small but highly ambitious company with millions of users worldwide relying on Foursquare to keep up with friends, discover what's nearby, save money and unlock deals. </p>

As our next PM, you get to help us answer these questions and come up with new ways for people to discover what’s around them.
